# Frappe Package Manager (FPM) Vision Document

## Executive Summary

FPM aims to revolutionize Frappe application deployment by introducing a robust package management system that eliminates Git dependencies in production environments. FPM will provide Maven-like capabilities for the Frappe ecosystem, enabling reproducible builds, offline deployments, and enterprise-grade dependency management.

## Vision Statement

To transform Frappe application deployment from a Git-centric development model into an enterprise-ready package management system that supports both traditional development workflows and modern DevOps practices.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Single binary CLI tool that "just works"
2. **Reliability**: Reproducible, version-specific deployments
3. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple repositories and deployment scenarios
4. **Enterprise-Ready**: Security, authentication, and offline capabilities
5. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Frappe workflows

## System Architecture

### Component Overview

1. **FPM CLI** (Go binary)
   - Package creation, installation, and repository management
   - Dependency resolution and validation
   - Configuration management

2. **Package Format** (.fpm files)
   - Self-contained ZIP archives with standardized structure
   - Metadata including dependencies, version constraints, and compatibility
   - Pre-built assets and installation hooks

3. **Repository System**
   - Multiple repository support (local, corporate, central, community)
   - Repository prioritization and fallback mechanisms
   - Standardized repository API with multiple implementations
